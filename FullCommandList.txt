If the first parameter is meant to be a username, then you can probably use "me"
instead of typing out your name. I have included this in some of the first
examples and then stopped including it because it was getting tedious. Some
commands will automatically use your name instead of the channel name and thus
won't require you to type your name or even "me." Just experiment to find out!
The first parameter can also be "this" to refer to the channel name without
typing it out. ("!followers this DendiFace This is how many followers you have")

I have also including SOME but not all aliases to commands. There are some
aliases that are for spelling errors or otherwise. I tried to include the most
commonly used command aliases.

A general rule of thumb:
Commands for regular viewers are limited to checking things about the current
channel. If they're a subscriber, they can check themselves. They they're a mod,
they can check other channels. Broadcaster has full access.

"<param>" means required
"[param]" means optional

"(int)" means integer .. a number (without a period preferred)


I'm sure I've missed a ton of stuff... If there are any question, don't hesitate
